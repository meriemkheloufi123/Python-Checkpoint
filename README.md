# Python-Checkpoint
 In my training with GOMYCODE as a student in Artificial Intelligence one of my projects was solving some problems using the necessary skills to dive deeper in AI. This repository represents my solutions of the second checkpoint of my training. Where we learnt how to solve many cases using Python and some others modules like Pandas and Numpy.
